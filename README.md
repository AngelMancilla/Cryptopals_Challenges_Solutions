# Cryptopals Crypto Challenges Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **Cryptopals Crypto Challenges**, a series of exercises designed to teach
cryptography through practical programming. These challenges cover a wide range of topics, from basic binary operations
to advanced cryptographic attacks, and help develop a deep understanding of how cryptography works in real-world
applications.

You can view the challenges at the official site: [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)

## Overview

- **Set 1**: Basics of cryptography. Includes operations like XOR, Base64 encoding, and basic cipher implementations.
- **Set 2**: Block ciphers. Focuses on AES, ECB mode, padding schemes, and attacks like the ECB detection.
- **Set 3**: Block and stream ciphers. Work on breaking ciphers like repeating-key XOR and others.
- **Set 4**: Stream ciphers and randomness. Implement and break stream ciphers, and understand cryptographic randomness.
- **Set 5**: Diffie-Hellman and related algorithms. Work with key exchange and implement Diffie-Hellman.
- **Set 6**: RSA and DSA. Work with public-key cryptography, RSA encryption, and Digital Signature Algorithm.
- **Set 7**: Hash functions and MACs. Implement and break hash functions, and work with HMAC (Hash-based Message
  Authentication Code).
- **Set 8**: Abstract Algebra. Work on mathematical concepts like modular arithmetic and their applications in
  cryptography.

## Structure
